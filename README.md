# mycart

This Project Covers all the following flow points metioned in the test paper
- Users should be able to view the list of multiple categories.
- Users should be able to view all the products under a particular category.
- Users should be able to view product details.
- Users should be able to add products to Cart.
- User should be able to search, sort and filter products
- Users should be able to buy multiple products from the Cart.
- Users should be able to remove products from the Cart.

Following improvements can still be made in this
- Use of redux instead of localstorage for cart management: The reason I did this way as there is no API connectivity and if I tend to refresh the page all the items in the cart would have gone

To run the project (use node version 8.16.2)
